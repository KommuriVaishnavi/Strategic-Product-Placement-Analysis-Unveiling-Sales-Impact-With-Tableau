# Strategic-Product-Placement-Analysis-Unveiling-Sales-Impact-with-Tableau-Visualization
This project leverages Tableau to examine how product placement influences sales performance and customer behavior. It delivers meaningful insights for retailers, content creators, and advertisers, enabling them to refine placement strategies, enhance audience engagement, and increase revenue through informed, data-driven decision-making.

By transforming raw data into interactive visual dashboards, the project uncovers patterns, trends, and correlations that might otherwise go unnoticed. These analytical insights support strategic planning and help businesses make smarter marketing and merchandising decisions.
